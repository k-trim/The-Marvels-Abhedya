# **Software Requirements Specification: SecureVault**

**Version:** 3.0 (Hackathon Master Blueprint)

**Hardware Target:** NVIDIA RTX 5070 (CUDA enabled)

## ---

**1\. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**

SecureVault is an intelligent, zero-knowledge secrets manager designed for both standard users and developers. It securely stores credentials while utilizing on-device, GPU-accelerated AI to proactively defend against breaches and audit user behavior, all without exposing plaintext data to external APIs.

### **1.2 Scope**

This specification outlines the three phases of the 24-hour hackathon build:

* **Phase 1:** Zero-Knowledge Core (React \+ Web Crypto API \+ Django).  
* **Phase 2:** Active Hash Auditing (Custom Python Heuristic Engine).  
* **Phase 3:** Local AI Defense (GPU-accelerated PyTorch and Local LLM Honeypots).

## ---

**2\. System Architecture**

* **Zero-Knowledge Pipeline:** All AES-256-GCM encryption occurs entirely in the React client's browser memory. Django acts as "dumb" storage, receiving only unrecognizable ciphertext.  
* **Local AI Edge:** To maintain strict data privacy, AI models (PyTorch RNN and Llama/Mistral) run entirely on the local localhost server, utilizing the host machine's RTX 5070 CUDA cores.

**4\. Implementation Plan & Functionalities**

### **Phase 1: Core Viability (The MVP)**

**Objective:** Build a functional, mathematically secure vault.

* **Functionality 1.1 (Key Derivation):** The React client derives a 256-bit AES key from the user's master password using PBKDF2 (100,000 iterations).  
* **Functionality 1.2 (Local Encryption):** React encrypts the vault payload (JSON) using AES-GCM, outputting Ciphertext, an IV, and a Salt.  
* **Functionality 1.3 (Dumb Storage):** Django receives the payload via a POST /store API and saves it to the database linked to the user's JWT session.  
* **Implementation:** React Web Crypto API (window.crypto.subtle) talking to Django REST Framework via Axios.

### **Phase 2: The DevSecOps Auditor**

**Objective:** Actively audit pasted secrets before they are encrypted.

* **Functionality 2.1 (Ephemeral Analysis):** When a user pastes a string, React sends it to an ephemeral Django endpoint POST /audit. Django does *not* save it.  
* **Functionality 2.2 (Heuristic Identification):** The auditor.py script checks string length, character sets (hexadecimal), and prefixes to identify developer tokens (JWT, AWS) or legacy hashes (MD5, SHA-1).  
* **Functionality 2.3 (Dynamic UI):** The endpoint returns a JSON risk profile. React dynamically updates the UI (e.g., flashing red for MD5 with a warning to rotate the credential).  
* **Implementation:** Pure Python string analysis ($O(1)$ complexity) integrated into a DRF API view.

### **Phase 3: Hardware-Accelerated Defense (RTX 5070\)**

**Objective:** Unleash the GPU to create active traps and deep-learning analysis.

* **Functionality 3.1 (Contextual LLM Honeypots):** Upon user registration, Django triggers a local LLM to generate mathematically valid but completely fake enterprise secrets (e.g., fake Stripe API keys). These are silently saved in the database as decoys to trap automated hacking tools.  
* **Functionality 3.2 (Deep Learning Predictability Score):** Instead of standard regex password rules, a local PyTorch Neural Network analyzes the user's master password to calculate the statistical probability of a human guessing that exact character sequence.  
* **Implementation:** \* *Honeypots:* Ollama running a lightweight model (e.g., Llama 3 8B) locally, accessed via Python subprocess or requests in Django.  
  * *Predictor:* A pre-trained PyTorch Character-RNN running on CUDA.

**5\. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR-1 (Zero-Knowledge Limit):** Master passwords and plaintext vault data must never be transmitted over the network to the backend or external APIs.  
* **NFR-2 (Latency):** Cryptographic operations and heuristic audits must complete in \< 500ms to prevent UI blocking.  
* **NFR-3 (Graceful Degradation):** If the CUDA environment fails or the Local LLM crashes, the system must bypass Phase 3 and fall back to Phase 2 functionality without locking the user out of their vault.
